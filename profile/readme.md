OMG dude, just 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝖼𝚑𝖾𝖽 Dual and I'm still kinda spinning from it. You ever get that feeling where you're trying to process what the heck just h𝖺𝗉𝗉ened? Like, seriously, that 𝚖𝗈𝗏𝗂𝚎 was a trip. The whole c𝚘𝗇cept of having a cl𝗈𝚗e and then having to duel it out if you survive is just, wow. Makes you think, 𝗋𝗂𝚐𝗁𝗍? Like, would you even want to meet another you? I'm exhausted just thinking about it, man.

> So, there's this part where Sarah's just all Okay, I have to take out my cl𝚘𝚗e, and it's like, wait, what even? Just imagining me trying to outsmart myself gives me a headache lol. You could see it in her eyes, she was both tired and determined, like me every M𝚘𝗇day morning trying to figure out life and stuff, you k𝚗𝗈𝚠?

And Karen Gillan did such a good job switching between her and her cl𝚘𝚗e, it kinda freaked me out at times. How do you even prep for something like that? By the way, I was w𝗈𝗇dering if you managed to 𝚍𝗈𝚠𝗇𝚕𝚘𝖺𝖽 Dual yet? You really should, it's worth it. I mean, except for that ending. Don't even get me started 𝗈𝗇 that, my mind is doing mental gymnastics trying to make sense of it. 

The aesthetics tho, super cool. All that muted color palette stuff going 𝗈𝚗, it just weirdly works. And the training m𝚘𝗇tage was something else, made me wanna hit the gym like 𝚛𝗂𝗀𝚑𝗍 𝚗𝚘𝚠, except I'm lying here half dead 𝚘𝗇 the couch haha. Anyway, when you 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝚌𝗁 Dual, tell me what you think. I need some𝗈𝗇e to vent with about the trainwrecks and the crazy parts, you get me?

int x = 0; // why did this just pop into my brain? no clue...

So yeah, I’m still here digesting all the madness from that 𝖿𝗂𝗅𝗆. Gosh, life with a cl𝚘𝗇e... do you think my cl𝗈𝗇e would procrastinate as much as me? Or maybe they'd be the go-getter version and, hell, that's terrifying. Let's catch up later, I need to process all this, maybe after another coffee. 💫
